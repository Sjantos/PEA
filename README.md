# PEA - Planning effective algorithms

Problem: TSP
Problem instances taken from [here](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/).
Solution is one program that contains all three algorithms.
I used TSPLib.Net library from [here](https://github.com/pdrozdowski/TSPLib.Net) to make life easier.

Implemented algorithms:
1. Dynamic programming
2. Tabu search
3. Genetic algorithm
